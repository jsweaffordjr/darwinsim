# darwinsim

These ROS packages are modifications of the packages from Generation Robots website:
https://www.generationrobots.com/en/content/83-carry-out-simulations-and-make-your-darwin-op-walk-with-gazebo-and-ros

That webpage describes in detail how to clone their ROS packages and get that simulator up and running.
Because these packages are based on their work, those instructions only need to be slightly modified for use with the MATLAB scripts and Simulink models 
that are in the "Darwin" repository. 

Simply use my modified packages instead of those, to get contact sensing with the feet and the other capabilities utilized in the MATLAB scripts/Simulink models.
