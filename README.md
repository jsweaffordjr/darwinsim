# darwinsim

These ROS packages are modifications of the packages from Generation Robots website:
https://www.generationrobots.com/en/content/83-carry-out-simulations-and-make-your-darwin-op-walk-with-gazebo-and-ros

That webpage describes in detail how to clone their ROS packages and get that simulator up and running.
Because these packages are based on their work, those instructions only need to be slightly modified for use with the MATLAB scripts and Simulink models 
that are in my "darwinrobot" repository. 

Simply use my modified packages instead of those, to get contact sensing with the feet and the other capabilities utilized in the MATLAB scripts/Simulink models from the "darwinrobot" repo. As a side note, one should be able to use the ROS packages from HumaRobotics directly and still use my MATLAB scripts/Simulink models to control the robot, just without some of the additional functionality (e.g., foot contact sensing).
